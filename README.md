## Support The Dev!

I very much appreciate you wanting to support me in my efforts! HNS can be donated to my wallet at `hs1qdnac0vrcjywvfdltcn973jf5m36c2tqt0w8aj9`. I'll also soon have a list of domains which can be purchased as well if you want to go down that route.

Thank you very much for your contributions and helping run hdns.co!
